## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is a static site (just HTML/CSS/JS), so GitHub Pages can host it directly.

1. Create a GitHub repo (e.g. `WhereShouldWeEat`) and push this folder.
2. In GitHub, go to **Settings** → **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**:
	- **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
	- **Branch**: `main` (or `master`) and **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**.

After it builds, your URL will be one of:

- Project site: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
- User/Org site (only if the repo is named `<your-username>.github.io`): `https://<your-username>.github.io/`
